HTML is codes used in web pages to show special characters like <, >, &, etc. without confusing the web browser. They are like instructions that tell the browser to display a specific character, symbol, or letter.

For Example:
&lt; represents less than sign(<)
&gt; represents greater than sign(>)
&amp; represents the ampersand(&)
&quot; represents the double quotation mark(")
&nbsp; represents a non-breaking space.
&copy; represents the copyright symbol.
