3 ways that help us improve the accessibility of HTML:

1. Describe Pictures:
If we have pictures on our website, it's important to tell people what's in the pictures. This helps the blind person to understand what's in the picture.

2. Use Headings and Lists:
When we have a lot of information on our page, we should use headings and lists. This helps people find what they are looking for quickly.

3. Keep forms simple:
If we have forms, we should keep them simple and easy to fill out and we should use labels to explain what information is needed in each box.
